 * A **file** is a specific stream of bytes.  A file is not the same as a file
   name.  Rather, a file is a snapshot of the contents of a file.
 * A **Folder** is a collection of files and other folders.  In the same way
   that a file is a snapshot, a folder is a snapshot of files and other folders.
 * A **Commit** is a shapshot of the root folder of a repository along with
   a collection of pointers to parent commits.
 * **Text** is any stream of unicode code points.
